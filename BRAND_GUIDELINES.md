# Blocks Brand Guidelines

The Blocks trademark and logo (“Blocks Trademarks”) are trademarks of Google, and are
treated separately from the copyright or patent license grants contained in the Apache-licensed
Blocks repositories on GitHub. Any use of the Blocks Trademarks other than those permitted in
these guidelines must be approved in advance. 

## Purpose of the Brand Guidelines

These guidelines exist to ensure that the Blocks project can share its technology under open
source licenses while making sure that the “Blocks” brand is protected as a meaningful source
identifier in a way that’s consistent with trademark law. By adhering to these guidelines, you help
to promote the freedom to use and develop high-quality Blocks technology.

## Acceptable Uses

Because we are open-sourcing the Blocks technology, you may use the Blocks trademark to
refer to the project without prior written permission. Examples of these approved references include
the following:

* To refer to the Blocks project itself;
* To refer to unmodified source code or other files shared by the Blocks repositories on GitHub;
* To accurately identify that your design or implementation is based on, is for use with, or is
compatible with the Blocks technology. 

Examples: 
* “[Your Product] for Blocks.”
* “[Your Product] made from Blocks.”
* “[Your Product] is a fork of the Blocks project.”
* “[Your Product] is based on the Blocks technology.”

# Usage Guidelines

* The Blocks name may never be used or registered in a manner that would cause confusion as to
  Google’s sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement.
* Don’t use the Blocks name, or a confusingly similar term, as part of your company name,
  product name, domain name, or social media profile.
* Other than as permitted by these guidelines, the Blocks name should not be combined with other
  trademarks, terms, or source identifiers.
* Don't remove, distort or alter any element of the Blocks Trademarks. That includes modifying
  the Blocks trademark, for example, through hyphenation, combination, or abbreviation. Do not
  shorten, abbreviate, remove the space from, or create acronyms out of the Blocks trademark.
* Don’t display the Blocks name using any different stylization, color, or font from the
  surrounding text.
* Don’t use the term Blocks as a verb, or use it in possessive form.
* Don’t use the Blocks logo on any website, product UI, or promotional materials without our
  prior written permission.
